# Alternative 1: Market-Aligned Discount Tiers (Conservative but Realistic)
# 
# Based on actual Databricks customer reports and documented Azure discounts.
# This configuration reflects real-world enterprise contracts and is recommended
# as the default tier structure.
#
# Key characteristics:
# - Entry-level discounts start at 10% (more realistic than 5%)
# - Aligns with Azure's documented 33-37% discounts for 1-3 year commits
# - Reflects real customer reports showing 14-32% cross-SKU discounts
# - Top tier reaches 50% for mega-deals ($5M+, 3-year commitments)
#
# Sources:
# - Azure Databricks documented discounts
# - Vendr customer negotiation data (2024-2025)
# - CloudChipr and industry pricing analysis
