# Alternative 3: Base Tiers with Stackable Add-On Incentives
# 
# Modular discount structure with conservative base rates plus stackable bonuses.
# This approach mimics real Databricks sales processes where discounts are built
# up through multiple negotiation levers.
#
# Structure:
# - Base discount rates (below)
# - Plus stackable incentive bonuses (documented in notes)
#
# Stackable Incentive Programs (add to base discount):
# ┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
# │ Multi-Cloud Commitment              │ +5% to +10%     │
# │ (AWS + Azure or 2+ clouds)          │                 │
# ├─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
# │ Competitive Displacement            │ +10% to +20%    │
# │ (from Snowflake, AWS EMR, etc.)     │                 │
# ├─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
# │ High Growth Commitment              │ +5% to +8%      │
# │ (2x+ year-over-year growth)         │                 │
# ├─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
# │ Annual Prepayment                   │ +3% to +5%      │
# │ (vs quarterly billing)              │                 │
# ├─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
# │ Support Fee Reduction               │ +5% to +10%     │
# │ (reduce from 15% to 10-12%)         │                 │
# └─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘

# Example: $2M, 3-year deal with multi-cloud + growth
# Base: 40% + Multi-cloud: 10% + Growth: 8% = 58% total

# - Vendr customer negotiation data showing stacked incentives
# - Real customer reports: "14% cross-SKU + 32% support reduction"
# - "By adding new use cases, increased SQL/DLT discount from 0% to 20%"
